# Zebrunner JUnit 4 agent

Official Zebrunner JUnit 4 agent providing reporting and smart reruns functionality. In order to enable Zebrunner Listener for JUnit no special configuration required - service discovery mechanism will automatically register listener once it will be available on your test application classpath.

# Checking out and building

To check out the project and build from source, do the following:

    git clone git://github.com/zebrunner/java-agent-junit.git
    cd java-agent-junit
    ./gradlew build

# Including into your project

Agent comes bundled with JUnit 4.13, so you may want to comment our your dependency or exclude it from agent.

# Agent configuration

Once agent is available on classpath of your test project it is automatically enabled and expects a valid configuration to be available.
It is currently possible to provide a configuration via: 

1. Environment variables 
2. Program arguments 
3. YAML file
4. Properties file

Configuration lookup will be performed in order listed above, meaning that environment configuration will always take precedence over YAML and so on.
It is also possible to override configuration parameters by supplying them via configuration provider having higher precedence.

Once configuration is in place agent is ready to track you test run events, no additional configuration required.

## Environment configuration

The following configuration parameters are recognized by agent:

- `REPORTING_ENABLED` - optional, default value: `true`. Enables or disables reporting. Once disabled - agent will use no op component implementations that will simply log output for tracing purpose
- `REPORTING_SERVER_HOSTNAME` - mandatory. Zebrunner server hostname
- `REPORTING_SERVER_ACCESS_TOKEN` - mandatory. Access token to be used to perform API calls. Can be obtained by visiting Zebrunner user profile page

## Program arguments configuration

The following configuration parameters are recognized by agent:

- `reporting.enabled` - optional, default value: `true`. Enables or disables reporting. Once disabled - agent will use no op component implementations that will simply log output for tracing purpose
- `reporting.server.hostname` - mandatory. Zebrunner server hostname
- `reporting.server.accessToken` - mandatory. Access token to be used to perform API calls. Can be obtained by visiting Zebrunner user profile page

## YAML configuration

Agent will recognize `agent.yaml` or `agent.yml` file residing in resources root folder. It is currently not possible to configure alternative file location.
Below is sample configuration file:

```yaml
reporting:
  enabled: true
  server:
    hostname: localhost:8080/api
    access-token: <token>

```

- `reporting.enabled` - optional, default value: `true`. Enables or disables reporting. Once disabled - agent will use no op component implementations that will simply log output for tracing purpose
- `reporting.server.hostname` - mandatory. Zebrunner server hostname
- `reporting.server.access-token` - mandatory. Access token to be used to perform API calls. Can be obtained by visiting Zebrunner user profile page

## Properties configuration

Agent will recognize `agent.properties` file residing in resources root folder. It is currently not possible to configure alternative file location.
Below is sample configuration file:

```properties
reporting.enabled=true
reporting.server.hostname=localhost:8080
reporting.server.access-token=<token>
```

- `reporting.enabled` - optional, default value: `true`. Enables or disables reporting. Once disabled - agent will use no op component implementations that will simply log output for tracing purpose
- `reporting.server.hostname` - mandatory. Zebrunner server hostname
- `reporting.server.access-token` - mandatory. Access token to be used to perform API calls. Can be obtained by visiting Zebrunner user profile page

# Advanced reporting

It is possible to configure additional reporting capabilities improving your tracking experience. 

## Collecting test logs

It is also possible to enable log collection for your tests. Currently three logging frameworks are supported out of the box: logback, log4j, log4j2.
In order to enable logging all you have to do is register reporting appender in your test framework configuration file.

### Logback

Sample **logback.xml**:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
    <appender name="ReportingAppender" class="com.zebrunner.agent.core.appender.logback.ReportingAppender">
       <encoder>
          <pattern>%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %-5level - %msg%n</pattern>
       </encoder>
    </appender>
    <root level="info">
        <appender-ref ref="ReportingAppender" />
    </root>
</configuration>
```

### Log4j

Sample **log4j.properties**:
```
log4j.rootLogger = INFO, zebrunner
log4j.appender.zebrunner=com.zebrunner.agent.core.appender.log4j.ReportingAppender
log4j.appender.zebrunner.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.zebrunner.layout.conversionPattern=pattern">[%d{HH:mm:ss}] %-5p (%F:%L) - %m%n
```

### Log4j2

Sample **log4j2.xml**:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration packages="com.zebrunner.agent.core.appender.log4j2">
   <properties>
      <property name="pattern">[%d{HH:mm:ss}] %-5p (%F:%L) - %m%n</property>
   </properties>
   <appenders>
      <ReportingAppender name="ReportingAppender">
         <PatternLayout pattern="${pattern}" />
      </ReportingAppender>
   </appenders>
   <loggers>
      <root level="info">
         <appender-ref ref="ReportingAppender"/>
      </root>
   </loggers>
</configuration>
```

## Capturing screenshots

In case you are using JUnit as a UI testing framework it might come handy to have an ability to track captured screenshots in scope of Zebrunner reporting.
Agent comes with a Java API allowing you to send your screenshots to Zebrunner so they will be attached to test run. 
Below is a sample code of test sending screenshot to Zebrunner:

```java
import com.zebrunner.agent.core.registrar.Screenshot;
import org.junit.Test;

public class AwesomeTests {

    @Test
    public void myAwesomeTest() {
        // capture screenshot 
        Screenshot.upload(screenshotBytes, capturedAtMillis);
        // meaningful assertions
    }

}
```

Screenshot should be passed as byte array along with unix timestamp in milliseconds corresponding to the moment when screenshot was captured. 
If `null` is supplied instead of timestamp - it will be generated automatically, however it is strongly recommended to include accurate timestamp in order to get accurate tracking. 

## Tracking test maintainer

You might want to add transparency to the process of automation maintenance by having an engineer responsible for evolution of specific tests or test classes.
Zebrunner comes with a concept of maintainer - a person that can be assigned to maintain tests. In order to keep track of those agent comes with `@Maintainer` annotation.
Test classes and methods can be annotated. It is also possible to override class-level maintainer on a mehtod-level.
See a sample test class below:

```java
import com.zebrunner.agent.core.reporting.Maintainer;
import org.junit.Test;

@Maintainer("kenobi")
public class AwesomeTests {

    @Test
    @Maintainer("skywalker")
    public void awesomeTest() {
        // meaningful assertions
    }

    @Test
    public void anotherAwesomeTest() {
        // meaningful assertions
    }


}
```

In the example above `kenobi` will be reported as a maintaner of `anotherAwesomeTest` (class-level value taken into account), while `skywalker` will be reported as a mainainer of test `awesomeTest`.
Maintainer username should be valid Zebrunner username, otherwise it will be set to `anonymous`.
